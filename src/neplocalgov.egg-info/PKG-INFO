## Nepal Local Governments

This is a simple package to get a list of local levels in Nepal (Rural Municipality,  Municipality and Metropolitian City) based on a given Province number/name or District name.

## Installation

You can install the package from PyPI using pip:

```
## Usage
The package contains only two simple functions  shown below

```
from neplocalgov import by_province, by_district

print(by_province(province="1")
print(by_district(district="Kathmandu")
```
If the supplied province / district is not valid, it returns Null. If data is found, it is returned as a list of dictionaries
